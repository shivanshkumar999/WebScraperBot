# Internship Assignment Web Scraper Bot using Huggingface

## 1. Use this following command to run the bot in conda base environment.

> python -m bot

## 2. Special Instructions.
<ul>
<li>Run the bot using the command. if the bot is given any commands present in list : ["close","no","bye","off"], then the bot will automatically turn off.</li>

<li>To perform web scraping, give the bot the dedicated command "pws" or "PWS". Anything entered other than this would give a genralized generative AI output. This has been intentionally done to mantain the discreteness of the bot. </li>

<li>If the bot is given any command present in list : ["close","no","bye","off"] after giving the "pws" command, then too the bot would stop the web scraping and ask you another questions.</li>

<li>You could at any multiple times perform this command.</li>

<li>This bot is based on huggingface API, so, basically what you are entering is an input to a genAI model. So, the output would be as expected as from a genAI model. Even if the input is wrong still the output would come, even in the case of web scraping. If you write web scraping or something, it would just give you some output but to perform web scraping dedicatedly, you could just type the dedicated command.</li>
</ul>
